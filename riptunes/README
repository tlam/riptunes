RipTunes
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RipTunes is a Python program which copy songs from ipods to your local machine.  It
runs on Windows, Linux and Mac.

Implementation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Most similar programs out there read the iPod database file, I am just reading the
  iPod as a regular filesystem.

Limitations
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have only tested it on the following type of iPods:
- iPod Mini Second generation
- iPod Nano First, Third generation
- iPod Classic Sixth generation

It doesn't work on the iPhone, the folder which holds the songs are not visible.
It's also possible that some songs with missing information or weird characters might
not be read properly.

Configuring and building:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's a long list of pre-requisites but the same Python codes run on Windows, Linux and
Mac.

1. MinGW - http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2435&package_id=240780
2. Python 2.6.1 - http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.6.1/
3. Qt OpenSource 4.4.3 - http://www.qtsoftware.com/downloads/opensource/appdev
4. SIP 4.7.9 - http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/sip/download
   For Windows, working from C:\tools\sip-4.7.9:
   - C:\tools\sip-4.7.9>python configure.py -p win32-g++
   - C:\tools\sip-4.7.9>"C:\MinGW\bin\mingw32-make.exe"
   - C:\tools\sip-4.7.9>"C:\MinGW\bin\mingw32-make.exe" install
5. PyQt 4.4.4 - http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download
   For windows, the make stage takes a while,
   - C:\tools\PyQt-win-gpl-4.4.4>C:\Qt\4.4.3\bin\qtvars.bat
   - C:\tools\PyQt-win-gpl-4.4.4>C:\Python26\python.exe configure.py
   - C:\tools\PyQt-win-gpl-4.4.4>"C:\MinGW\bin\mingw32-make.exe"
   - C:\tools\PyQt-win-gpl-4.4.4>"C:\MinGW\bin\mingw32-make.exe" install
6. Mutagen 1.15 - http://code.google.com/p/quodlibet/downloads/list
7. Add C:\Qt\4.4.3\bin in your PATH if it's not there.

Running
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To run the program, double-click RipTunes.pyw

Goal of this project
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I just wanted a program which can copy songs from iPods which run on all 3 major platforms.
I used Python and Qt because they are platform independent.  There are probably much
better similar programs out there but they usually run only on one specific OS instead of
the big three.

This project also demonstrates my basic knowledge of:
- OO programming
- Python
- Qt
- Building and linking libraries

Open source project

The project is hosted at Google Code at http://code.google.com/p/riptunes/
